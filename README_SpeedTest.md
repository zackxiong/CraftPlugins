# Speedtest
This is a program used to accurately(very accurate) monitor how dong does it take for a program to finish. 

#### Usage
A program can be loaded either as a file or as a command(in this case parameters could be attached). Depending on which shell your system is using, we suggest users to add `cmd.exe`(for window users) or `sh`|`bash`(for unix-like system users depending on which shell is used) so that the program will work exactly the same as it is in a command prompt.
In the case that a running program stucks or waiting for input, use the killall button to get rid of it.
