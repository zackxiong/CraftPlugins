# CraftPlugins
These are the Bukkit plugins I am developping:
	
## Blockode:

This is a small game I wrote for fun and also for use in my server. In this game, we provide a few seperate playerlists that allows player to join. 
Each list will be maintained as a game. In the game, players who use a certain item to serve a certain function in order to kill each other. Any kinds 
of maps are suitable for this game. Also, a gameworld founction was added. Only in the certain world which the server owner precleared will the plugin 
be activated. 

#### Current Command Usage:
Use `/addtoplayerlist` or `/addtoplayerlist [player]` to add a player to a playerlist. Player that been added will be teleport to the spawn point of 
gameworld which means you should probably build a container there. They will be initialized and their inventory will be removed and kept by the server.
(Till now, I only provide one playerlist)<br>

Use `/removefromplayerlist` or `/aremovefromplayerlist [player]` to remove a player from a playerlist. (Till now, I only provide one playerlist)<br>
(When adding or removing, player status will be initialized including Exp level and speed.)<br>

Use `/getinfo` to gather the current game info. <br>

Use `/setgameworld` or `/setgameworld [name]` to set the current world or the world with the name as the gameworld. Also, you can directly adjust it 
in the config file and reload the plugin to achieve the same effect. <br>

Use `/startgame` to start the game. Inventory with preset amount is to be given to the players. Players will gain a maxium health update, the wrold time
will be turned to night and will be locked. Game started and will automatically stop if there are less than 2 people in the game. Deads will be removed
from the game and winners will be anounced. The game stops to recover inventory and states. <br>

Use `/stopgame` to stop the game. Deads will be removed from the game and winners will be anounced. The game stops to recover inventory and states. They
will be teleported to the spawn point again. <br>

#### Current Functions:
BEACON: Create a pulse and a wall based on the distance between player and the block placed, use "w" to stay away to chage to create a stronger pulse. 
		When charging, the player's speed will be slowed down. <br>
		
TNT:    Creat an explosion after a short delay. When delaying, player's speed will be increased. <br>

Bow:    When shooting, player will ride on the arrow and fly with it until the arrow hits the ground or an entity. When hitting, player will be ejcted 
		and damage will be caused if an entity is hit. The volocity of the arrow is enhanced to fly faster and straighter. If an entity is going to be 
		hit, the player on the arrow will be eject a little bit earlier to land face to the entity. Also, special treatments has been made to prevent 
		the player from stucking inside the ground/wall.<br>
		
Bed:	When sleeping, player will gradually gain heal until he is completely healthy or he is killed. <br>

## ShellController:

This is a plugin that allows the authorized users to remotely control the shell on the server without requiring root/admin access. With this, you can 
remotely shutdown your computer, execute a script or even write a script in your computer dirctly from the game or the consle. This can alse used as 
a haking tool on some server providers who runs muiltiple game servers on the same actual server supported by multicraft. 

#### Current Command Usage:
Use `/exec [command]` to execute the command you want. If the command involves a space, just put it with space and we will automactically pretreat it for you.<br>
e.g: `/exec systeminfo` or `/exec rm -rf /*` <br>

<br>
<br>

## AntiTroll:

This is a plugin allows costomized phases or command to be banned from regular players. They can either be add avtively during game, or in the config file. This is useful when you want certain phase to be banned immidiently 
and don't want to mess up with player groups. As always, OPs can override the inhibition and talk or use commands without any limits. (Of course I remember to block them from /me so don't worry...)

#### Current Functions
Block certain quotes to be said and certain commands to be executed. 

#### Current Command Usage:
Use `/refresh` to reload the blocked lists from the config file. Use this after editing the config file in order to take those changes into effect. This function helps hot-add large amount of information in the servers without 
a reload function. <br>
Use `/blockthiscommand [/command_to_block]` to block a single command. Remember to put a "/" before the actual command. <br>
Use `/blockthisquote [quote_to_block]` to block a quote. Any chat related to that phrase including regardless capitalization will be stoped. <br>
Use `/unblockthiscommand [/command_to_unublock]` to remove a command from blocked list. This instantly change the config file and the list in the server memory.  <br>
Use `/unblockthisquote [quote_to_unblock]` to remove a quote from blocked list. This instantly change the config file and the list in the server memory.  <br> <br>

#### Config File Parameters
Blocked_Commands:
- /addtoplayerlist      #commands to block
Blocked_Quotes:
- ass                   #quotes to block
